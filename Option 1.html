 <h1> Take the candle and match and hide </h1>
	<body style="background-color:LightSteelBlue">
	<p style= "text-align:center"> You take the candle and the match and hid in the closet. You noticed a person enter the room. You watched them through the cracks of the door as the person bolted out of the room trying to look for you. After your kidnapper leaves, you waited until you hear nothing. After the coast was clear, you lit the candle and navigated the house without getting caught. When you saw the front door, you ran out of the house as fast as you can and never looked back.</p>
